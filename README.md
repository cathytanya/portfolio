# Homework #2 : Portfolio

The purpose of this assignment is to show our understanding of applying CSS to html
Inside this repository, it will contain my website as well as images that will be called from the html and css to produce.
There was a submodule named "Projects" which I have accidently added and I cannot remove. 
There is no link that calls to that folder.
When it came to calling applicatioins I called the gitPages from the preWork assignment and Homework#1.
